        Hello! I'm Stef, a dual-citizen of the USA and the Netherlands,
        and a Senior Computer Science student from Portland, wrapping
        up my undergraduate degree at Oregon State University. I'm 
        particularly driven by the boundless potential of free and
        open-source software, a passion I follow through my personal
        projects.

        <br><br>

        My academic journey at Oregon State has encompassed a wide range
        of topics, from algorithms and web development (evident in my
        Capstone project), to databases, operating systems, and theory
        of computation.

        <br><br>

        When I'm not studying or coding, you might find me strumming the
        guitar, exploring the worlds of classic video games like Star Fox 64
        for the Nintendo 64, crafting inventive cocktails for friends, or
        experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. These creative outlets
        help balance my technical endeavors and fuel my problem-solving skills.

        <br><br>

        Looking forward, I'm eagerly seeking a Summer 2024 internship
        in the Portland area. Following this internship, I plan to harness my
        dual-citizenship by moving to the Netherlands to pursue an MSc in Computer 
        Science. This will allow me to deepen my technical expertise, gain a 
        global perspective, and experience the culture of my second home. My 
        aspiration is to become a successful software engineer in a company 
        that shares my advocacy for FOSS.
