        Hello! I'm Stef, a Senior Computer Science
        student from Portland, currently finishing
        my undergraduate degree at Oregon State
        University. I have a passion for free and
        open-source software, which is something am
        trying to work on through personal projects.

        <br><br>

        At Oregon State University, I have studied
        a wide variety of topics, including algorithms,
        web development (especially though my Capstone
        project), databases, operating systems, and
        theory of computation.
