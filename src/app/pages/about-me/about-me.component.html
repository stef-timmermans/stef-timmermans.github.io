        Hello! I'm Stef, a dual citizen of the USA and the Netherlands, and a
        master's student at the University of Groningen (Rijksuniversiteit
        Groningen) in the Netherlands. I am pursuing an MSc in Computing Science,
        focusing on Data Science and Systems Complexity. I obtained my BSc in
        Computer Science with a focus in Computer Systems from Oregon State University
        in the United States. I anticipate completing my MSc at the end of the
        2025/2026 academic year.

        <br><br>

        When I'm not studying or coding, you might find me cheering on my alma
        mater's American football team, exploring classic video games,
        crafting inventive cocktails for friends, or experimenting with new
        recipes in the kitchen. These creative outlets strike a balance with
        my other focus on my more technical pursuits.

        <br><br>

        Looking forward, I am eagerly seeking internships for 2025 and 2026, both
        during the academic year and summer months. I am open to commuting or
        working remotely and comfortable in both English and Dutch work environments.

        <br><br>

        Thus far, my coding journey has been quite varied in terms of topics. More
        specifically, I have studied the following extensively:
        <ul>
            <li>C/C++</li>
            <li>Algorithms and Theory of Computation</li>
            <li>Operating Systems, System Calls, and Traps</li>
            <li>Database Management Systems</li>
            <li>Assembly Concepts (including x86, Microchip AVR, and MIPS)</li>
            <li>Computer Architecture</li>
            <li>Web Development Frameworks</li>
            <li>Version Control and Best Practices</li>
        </ul>

        it exist (for now?).
